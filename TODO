Minimap
--------

-check if there is a better way to distinguish the player
-might need to change the order of rendering. ships may overlap the ui??
-check the overall design/logic

-will need to put some calculations into variables to allow for easier changes later


Bullets
--------

-physics are still off, seems like it doesnt take into account the ships velocity (bullets speed might just be to fast)
